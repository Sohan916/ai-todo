# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

## Commands

- Dev server: `vp dev`
- Check everything (format + lint + types): `vp check`
- Auto-fix formatting: `vp fmt`
- Run tests: `vp test`

## Conventions

- This project uses **Vite+** (`vp`) as the only toolchain. Do not add Prettier,
  ESLint, or a separate test runner. Use `vp` for everything: deps, checks, tests,
  build.
- Organize by feature: a feature's code lives in `src/features/<name>/` and is imported
  through its `index.ts` barrel (e.g. `@/features/tasks`). Shared UI goes in
  `src/components/`, framework-agnostic helpers in `src/lib/`.
- TypeScript is strict. No `any`; type every function parameter and return.
- After any code change, run `vp check` and `vp test` and fix what they report
  **before** considering the work done.
- Never commit directly to `main`. Work on a feature branch.
